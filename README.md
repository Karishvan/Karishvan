<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Karishvan Ragunathan! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h3 align="center">Welcome to my GitHub profile! </h3>
  I'm a 2nd year Computer Science Co-op student at Toronto Metropolitan University passionate about Software Development and technology. I find it interesting to learn new languages and technologies so I can use my skills to create something innovative. Here you'll find some of the projects I've been working on during and outside of school.

## My Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

- [QuickFix](https://github.com/Karishvan/QuickFix): An advanced bug reporting system that allows users on the same software development project to keep track of ongoing bugs within each sprint
- [MedVisor](https://github.com/Karishvan/MedVisor): A simple web application survey that gathers data of the user's symptoms and uses Machine Learning to provide a suggestion of the doctor they should visit
- [MyAudio](https://github.com/Karishvan/MyAudio): A Java terminal application using OOP that simulates a music app, allowing users to create playlists and play songs and audiobooks
- [Boggle](https://github.com/Karishvan/Elixir-Boggle): An Elixir program that simulates a round in boggle but finds all valid words on a square boggle board

Feel free to explore more of my projects on my [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/Karishvan?tab=repositories).
